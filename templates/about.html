    <p><a href="/">MediaCrush</a> is a brand new, <a href="https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush">open source</a> website
    for hosting your media. You can host your images, audio, and video on MediaCrush, totally free - and we're adding support
    for more kinds of media all the time. There are lots of media hosting websites, though. What makes MediaCrush special?</p>

        <h2>Privacy</h2>
        <p>In the age of government deciet and privacy invasion, many people need to take <a href="https://prism-break.org" target="_blank">extra measures</a>
        to defend their privacy. MediaCrush is the only host that cares deeply about your privacy. When you use MediaCrush, you're always
        using https - so your connection is secure. We store nothing about you when you use our site. Plus, we're
        completley open about our activities: we <a href="https://blog.mediacru.sh">publicize reports</a> on everything
        we do.</p>

        <h2>Speed</h2>
        <p>We've invested in hefty servers and lots of bandwidth. We'll serve up your media crazy fast. We also do a bunch
        of tricks to make it even faster (don't worry, it's all lossless). For instance, GIFs hosted on MediaCrush are,
        on average, <strong>1500% faster</strong> than other services like imgur and minus. We convert them to HTML5 video
        and they get seriously better speed. See for yourself on the <a href="/demo">demo page</a>.</p>

    <div class="summary">
        <img src="/static/mediacrush_logo.svg" alt="Convenient" width=128 height=128 />
        <h2>Convenience</h2>
        <p>MediaCrush is simple and easy to use. We don't have any extra junk - we just host media. We do have ads (we've
        got to keep the servers running somehow), but <a href="javascript:adOptOut();">click here</a> and you'll never see
        them. MediaCrush also integrates with Windows, Mac, Linux, and mobile devices - check out the details on our
        <a href="/apps">apps</a> page. There's also the great <a href="/docs">API</a> we offer to developers, free of charge.

    <p>Oh, and did you notice that 25 MB upload limit? That's more than imgur and minus <em>combined</em>, and we don't reduce
    the quality after you upload like imgur does. So, like what you see? Head over to <a href="/">https://mediacru.sh</a> to
    start uploading your media. You can follow
    <a href="https://twitter.com/mediacru_sh">@mediacru_sh</a> on Twitter to hear the latest news. You can also subscribe to
    <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/mediacrush">/r/mediacrush</a> to offer your ideas and get help.</p>
    <p>That's all we've got to say! We're glad to have you here.</p>
